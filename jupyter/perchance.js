          // var message = "<div style='overflow:hidden;height:0px;'><h1>Create a Random Generator</h1><p>Perhance is a platform that allows you to create your own custom random generators. You could use it to create your own random text generator for a tabletop RPG, or to make your own random name generator, or to simply create a generator which selects a random item from your list with different weights. You can also save your generator so it has a permalink that you can share with your friends.</p><p>Perchance is based around creating lists which reference other lists. You can adjust the odds of items in each list so that when you randomly select an item from that list, they all have the likelihoods that you've specified. If you'd like to learn how to make a random text generator with Perchance, you should check out the tutorial. It explains all the basic features of the Perchance engine and should get you up and running in only 10 or 20 minutes. Perchance has many powerful features that you don't need to learn from the start, but can learn later if you want to create particularly complex generators.</p><p>I created Perchance because most people are still creating random generators in excel. Those work all right, but excel and other spreadsheets aren't really made for that purpose, so there's a lot to be desired in terms of functionality and ease of use. Whatever you're using it for, I hope you find Perchance useful! You might like to check out our <a href='http://reddit.com/r/perchance'>community forum</a> where you can ask questions and share your random generator creations.</p></div>(」ﾟﾛﾟ)｣ Sorry! Perchance uses cutting edge browser features that are only available in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox. All modern browsers will eventually be supported, but for now you'll need to use one of those two. Sorry again for the inconvenience!";

One potential cause is that (as of writing) some ad blockers break <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/blob/9effb98d0ab3be8bc320909144758a326e575ad8/filters/quick-fixes.txt#L160" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">basic</a><sup>1</sup> functionality of Perchance pages. This <b>includes pages that don't have any ads</b> - i.e. even "normal" (non-AI-powered) generators.</p>

                <p>Try turning off your browser's ad blocker for this page, and if that doesn't work then please report this problem at <a href="https://lemmy.world/c/perchance" target="_blank">lemmy.world/c/perchance</a>, since there may be some other cause.</p>

                <p style="opacity:0.55;">Note: Perchance only has ads on generators which require GPU resources - a tiny fraction of all pages on Perchance. Perchance has always been <u>completely</u> free, and I've been paying for server resources out of my own pocket since I built Perchance in 2017, but I can't do that for the newly-added AI plugins because they require many GPU servers and they're way too expensive. As of writing (Jan 20th 2023) ads still aren't enough to cover the GPU costs, but they help a lot.</p>

                <p style="opacity:0.55;"><sup>1 </sup><span style="font-size:85%;">The linked code makes your ad blocker extension override some code on this page such that when I (or Perchance generator authors) want to check if some text contains a word (a very basic/common programming operation), it'll always say that the text <i>does</i> contain the word, even when it doesn't. That makes it hard to write code that works correctly, and to make changes to existing code without breaking things.</span></p>`;
